Notifications provide updates about the activity on qmBase that you've subscribed to. You can use the notifications inbox to customize, triage, and manage your updates.

## About participating and watching notifications

When you watch a repository, you're subscribing to updates for activity in that repository. Similarly, when you watch a specific team's discussions, you're subscribing to all conversation updates on that team's page. For more information, see "About team discussions."

To see repositories that you're watching, go to your watching page. For more information, see "Managing subscriptions and notifications on GitHub."

You can configure notifications for a repository on the repository page, or on your watching page.

## About custom notifications

You can customize notifications for a repository. For example, you can choose to only be notified when updates to one or more types of events (issues, pull requests, releases, security alerts, or discussions) happen within a repository, or ignore all notifications for a repository. For more information, see "Configuring your watch settings for an individual repository" below.

## Participating in conversations

Anytime you comment in a conversation or when someone @mentions your username, you are participating in a conversation. By default, you are automatically subscribed to a conversation when you participate in it.
You can unsubscribe from a conversation you've participated in manually by clicking Unsubscribe on the issue or pull request or through the Unsubscribe option in the notifications inbox.

For conversations you're watching or participating in, you can choose whether you want to receive notifications on GitHub or by email in your notification settings. For more information, see "Choosing your notification settings."

For example:

If you don't want notifications to be sent to your email, unselect email for participating and watching notifications.
If you want to receive notifications by email when you've participated in a conversation, then you can select email under "Participating".
If you do not enable "Notify me: On GitHub" for watching or participating notifications, then your notifications inbox will not have any updates.
